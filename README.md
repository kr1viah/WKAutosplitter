Some things to note:
You can tweak the settings in game at any time in settings -> mods -> autosplitter gear icon

  Most of the settings there are pretty self-explanitory, but here's a list of the settings and what they do

	split on death                       (default: disabled)         Splits the timer when you die
	reset on death                       (default: enabled)	         Resets the timer when you die
	reset on exiting to title screen     (default: enabled)          Resets when quitting to title screen
	split on boss kill                   (default: enabled)          Splits when you kill a boss
	only split on first boss             (default: enabled)          When you kill a boss or a new boss spawns, and it has already been seen in the current run, the timer won't split
	split on unlocks                     (default: disabled)         Splits when unlocking something in game, including achievements
	split on escaped window              (default: disabled)         Splits when you escape the main window
	split on broken  window              (default: disabled)         Splits when you break  the main window
	split on boss spawn                  (default: disabled)         Splits when a new boss spawns
	split on orb weapon                  (default: disabled)         Splits when getting the orb weapon
	split on token                       (default: disabled)         Splits when grabbing a token
	split on perk                        (default: disabled)         Splits when losing a token (when you buy a perk)
	split on ??? hit                     (default: disabled)         Splits when you hit ???
	port                                 (default: 16834)            The port the mod tries to connect to when launching the game. Should be the same as livesplit -> right click -> settings -> port (down at the bottom)
